# Implementation of UCDNet and ensemble learning script 
Fully Convolutional Neural Network model based on architecture proposed by K. S. Basavaraju - UCDNet (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9740122). 


Ensemble learning - soft weighted voting based on results obtain from FC-EF, FC-Siam-conc, FC-Siam-diff (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08462) and UCDNet. 

# Jupyter notebook and other models come from: 
https://github.com/rcdaudt/fully_convolutional_change_detection
Models  such FC-EF, FC-Siam-conc and FC-Siam-diff can be downloaded and then train, test using fully-convolutional-change-detection.ipynb

Pretrained models available here in catalogue 'Trained models'
